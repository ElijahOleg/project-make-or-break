# MOB Team - Make or Break

The purpose of this project is to build something cool... together as a team.

Angular and Foundation front-end, Express and MongoDB back-end. But the tech doesn't matter. This is about changing the game.

The MOB team will provide a service to users to allow them to provide services as long as the user donates to a named charity.
